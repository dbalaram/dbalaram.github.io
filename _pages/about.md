I’m a Senior Research Engineer and Project Lead at Volkswagen Group Innovation, driving research projects in perception and AI tooling. My work focuses on vision-language search and retrieval, 3D generative design, and semantic understanding through robotics and computer vision. I lead multiple research initiatives, define technical direction, mentor early-career engineers, and shape strategy for high-impact innovation efforts.

In previous roles, I've developed both deep learning and classical computer vision systems including building GAN-based pipelines for creative applications, designing reinforcement learning agents using contextual bandits, and working on fine-grained recognition tasks using vision transformers for stylistic attribute detection. My work bridges foundational research and rapid prototyping, with a strong focus on solving real-world problems across diverse domains.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about education - specifically, how different teaching pedagogies can enhance students’ understanding of foundational concepts in math and English. I analyze data from schools in India that emphasize peer-learning environments and am particularly interested in how these approaches impact students across diverse socioeconomic and regional backgrounds.

### Focus Areas

- **3D Computer Vision**  
  Developing diffusion models for point-clouds and 3D meshes for generation and structural understanding in 3D environments, supporting tasks like simulation, design, and perception.

- **Self-Supervised Learning**  
  Building vision-based systems that leverage unlabeled data for fine-grained classification, content filtering, and semantic scene understanding across real-world scenarios.

- **Search & Retrieval**  
  Designing multimodal retrieval systems to surface rare and corner-case scenarios from millions of camera views and driving frames, enabling validation and safety analysis in autonomous vehicle datasets.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**  
  Designing multi-level clustering frameworks to study how electric vehicles are charged and used; specifically to inform downstream tasks of determining batery state of health.
